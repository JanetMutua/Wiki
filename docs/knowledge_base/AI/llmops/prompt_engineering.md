# Prompt Engineering

[Prompt Engineering](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-prompt-engineering) refers to the practice of designing/crefting effective prompts to improve the reliability and accuracy of AI models.

Prompts enable AI models to:

- Understand intent
- Follow instructions
- Generate desired outputs

Additionally, Prompt Engineering helps you optimize prompts in order to control an LLMs output.

Crafting a good prompt is the difference between a reliable and an unreliable model. But what metrics define a good prompt? 

## Defining Prompts

Below are a few tips on crafting concise prompts to improve AI model accuracy.
