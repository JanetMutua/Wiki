# Kali Linux Overview

## Introduction

Kali Linux is a specialized distribution (distro) of the Linux operating system based on Ubuntu Linux. Ubuntu Linux is based on **Debian Linux**. A Linux distro is a collection of software packages selected by the distro maintainers.

Different distros have different package managers, for instance:

- RedHat and its associated distros like Fedora Core and RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) use the RedHat Package Manager (RPM) format. RedHat uses both the RPM utility and the YellowDog Updater Modified (yum).
- Debian uses the Advanced Package Tool (APT) to manage packages in the Debian package format.

You can use Kali Linux if you are interested in:

- Exploit development
- Digital forensics
- Security testing
- Reverse engineering
