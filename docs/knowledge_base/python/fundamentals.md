# Python Fundamentals

## Introduction

[Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/) is a dynamically typed and interpreted language that supports multiple programming paradigms such as:

- Procedural programming
- Object-oriented programming
- Functional programming

Python is an ideal language for scripting and [Rapid Application Development](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/software-engineering-rapid-application-development-model-rad/).

You can also use Python as an extension language for any customizable apps.

You can easily [extend the Python interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/index.html#extending-index) with new functions and data types. That is, those that are implemented in C, C++, or even other languages callable from C.



Python is a high-level language with high-level data types built in. Examples:

- Dictionaries
- Flexible arrays

These high-level data types gives you more leeway to express complex code as a single statement.

Additionally, Python comes with a large collection of standard modules that provide functionalities like:

- System calls
- File I/O
- Interfaces to graphical interface toolkits i.e., Tk

While building on top of the standard module, you can also split your programs into modules for further reuse with different Python programs. 

## Key Language Features

Here are some notable language features to keep in mind:

- **Python is interpreted:** no compilation or linking (Python handles dependencies and module imports dynamically) is necessary. 
- **Python is indented:** you don't need opening or closing brackets like in JavaScript
- **Python is extensible and usable for system-level programming:** you can [link a C/ C++ program](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html) and use Python as a command language or extension. This means that you end up using Python for high-level logic and C for performance-critical parts of your program.
